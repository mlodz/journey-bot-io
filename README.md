# journey-bot-io
An interactive game for young kids (3-6yo) that introduces the concept of programming.



## Version 1

Version 1 will be a minimal viable product; it will have just enough functionality that it "works", and I will not spend much time on styling or graphics.

### Functionality TODO
[x] Controls - there are buttons for "move", "left", "right".
[x] Board - display a grid of X by Y that the bot can move on
[x] Bot - A token on the Board that we can move/control via the Controls
[x] An "execute" button that runs the commands.
[x] As the bot moves, there may not be animation, but there will be timing, that is, I will add delay so I can see that the bot follows the commands correctly
[x] There will be no "missions" or "goals", only the ability to move the bot around the board
[ ] May not be cross-browser compatible

## Version 2
Version 2 will be more polished and at a level where I can let the kids playtest it.
[ ] Styling - theme and characters, looks good
[ ] Audio and sound fx
[ ] Stable - relatively bug free, no bugs that interfere with typical use
[ ] Works on iPad in landscape mode

## Version 3
Version 3 will add "missions" and "goals"

[ ] Mission Types
[ ] Level's/Stages: Level 1 is a mission, 2 is a mission, etc. Complete one to get to next.
[ ] Go from point A to B
[ ] Go from point A to B and optionally collect stars along the way
[ ] Avoid Lava/Obstacles
[ ] New Action - beep, this allows interaction with other objects on the board. A bug might be scared away. A door might open.
